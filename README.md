# Central Vision System

AsteriaTech Mobile is a mobile app for controlling a vision system, developed with Android Jetpack Compose. It provides real-time control and both thermal and normal image data from the vision system via WebSocket communication. The vision system features a servo motor for horizontal movement and cameras for data capture, which is sent to a server and then to the Android client.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Control**: Precise servo movements.
- **Live Telemetry**: Real-time normal and thermal camera data.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Efficient, reliable data transmission with two channels.
- **Detection Alerts**: Notifications for detected living presence.
- **Command Execution**: Adjust system orientation.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Smooth operations with Retrofit, Coil, and ExoPlayer.
- **Modular Architecture**: Scalable code with Clean Architecture and MVVM.
- **AOP**: Improved modularity with Aspect-Oriented Programming.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Android Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI development.
- **Kotlin**: Programming language for Android.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication.
- **Hilt**: Dependency injection.
- **Retrofit**: Network requests.
- **Coil**: Image loading.
- **ExoPlayer**: Media playback.
- **Clean Architecture**: Scalable codebase.
- **MVVM**: Lifecycle-conscious data management.
- **AOP**: Modular cross-cutting concerns.
